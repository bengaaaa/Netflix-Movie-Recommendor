# Netflix-Movie-Recommendor
Using a real data set from Netflix, created a program to get hundreds of thousands of reviews and store them in a data structure, then given a user and a movie is able to make a prediction of their rating within 0.8 stars using a k-nearest neighbors algorithm
I only included the first 100 text files in the movie data instead of the full 2000
